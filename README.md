## Purpose
This application caters to users who want to keep track of their books and the authors who published those books. The library that was used to create this application is React, a JavaScript library that makes UI components and state of selected variables more efficient. The framework that was also used to create this application is Next.JS, a framework built, improving React to perform additional tasks like _routing_ and _data fetching_.

## Features
- The User can perform **CRUD** on both the Authors and Books.
   - The "C" in CRUD stands for Create. So the user has the ability to create an author or a book.
   - The "R" in CRUD stands for Read. So the user has the ability to view an author or a book on the webpage.
   - The "U" in CRUD stands for Update. So the user has the ability to update an author or a book.
   - The "D" in CRUD stands for Delete. So the user has the ability to delete an author or a book.

## Challenges met
